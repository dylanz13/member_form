        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p>This project is a simple member list application demonstrating basic (pure) HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. It includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A form to add new members with fields for name, description, age, image URL, and favorite hobby. Name, description, and image URL are required fields.</li>
            <li>Visual indication (red asterisk) for required fields and a red outline for empty required fields after they lose focus.</li>
            <li>A list that dynamically updates with new member cards containing the entered information.</li>
            <li>Individual delete buttons for each member card and an animation for adding and removing cards.</li>
            <li>A delete all button to clear the member list and a search functionality to filter members.</li>
        </ul>
